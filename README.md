# A tale of Rest and GraphQL
This project brings up a Rest API server written in Flask and a GraphQL server powered by Hasura (https://hasura.io/). Both of them stand on a Postgresql database filled with data from https://data.nasa.gov/Raw-Data/Extra-vehicular-Activity-EVA-US-and-Russia/9kcy-zwvn :rocket:. 
This project can be used to show differences between the two API styles.
